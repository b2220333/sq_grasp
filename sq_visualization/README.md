# Superquadric Poses Visualization
===================================

ROS indigo does not provide any option to visualize geometry_msgs/PoseArray msg as axes. This visualization provides a new display type in SqVisualization(go to the bottom of Rviz panel window) which can show multiple poses as axes.

The poses of the superquadrics are published as a geometry_msgs/PoseArray.
