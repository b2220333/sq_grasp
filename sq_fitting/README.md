# Superquadics Fitting
============================

### Real time superquadric fitting on objects in dense clutter

A superquadric can be defined a generalized quadric in
which the exponents of the implicit representation of the sur-
face are arbitrary real numbers, allowing for a more flexible
set of shapes while keeping the symmetry characteristics of
the regular quadric.
