# Superquadics Fitting
============================

### Real time superquadric fitting on objects in dense clutter

A superquadric can be defined a generalized quadric in
which the exponents of the implicit representation of the sur-
face are arbitrary real numbers, allowing for a more flexible
set of shapes while keeping the symmetry characteristics of
the regular quadric. A superquadric can be obtained as the spherical
product of two superellipses *S1* and *S2* , to obtain the
parametric equation

with *n* is between *-PI/2* and *PI/2* and *w* is between *-PI* and *PI*, where *a1, a2, a3* are the scaling factors of the three principal axes, the exponent *e1* controls the shape of the superellipsoid's cross-section in the planes orthogonal to *(x,y)* plane and *e2* controls the shape of the superellipsoid's cross-section parallel to the *(x,y)* plane.
