# Superquadics Fitting
============================

### Real time superquadric fitting on objects in dense clutter

A superquadric can be defined a generalized quadric in
which the exponents of the implicit representation of the sur-
face are arbitrary real numbers, allowing for a more flexible
set of shapes while keeping the symmetry characteristics of
the regular quadric. A superquadric can be obtained as the spherical
product of two superellipses *S1* and *S2* , to obtain the
parametric equation
