# Superquadics Fitting
============================

### Real time superquadric fitting on objects in dense clutter

A superquadric can be defined a generalized quadric in
which the exponents of the implicit representation of the sur-
face are arbitrary real numbers, allowing for a more flexible
set of shapes while keeping the symmetry characteristics of
the regular quadric.

A superquadric can be obtained as the spherical product of two superellipses  $S_1$ and $S_2$, to obtain the parametric equation

\begin{equation}
r(\eta, \omega) = S_1 \big(\eta) \oplus S_2 \big(\omega) =\left(\begin{array}{c} a_1\cos^{\epsilon_1} \eta \cos^ {\epsilon_2} \omega \\ a_2\cos^{\epsilon_1} \eta \sin^ {\epsilon_2} \omega \\a_3\sin ^{\epsilon_1} \eta \end{array}\right),
\label{eq:superParam}
\end{equation}
with $\eta  \in[\frac{-\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$ and $\omega \in[-\pi, \pi]$,
